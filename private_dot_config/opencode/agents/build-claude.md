Implement approved work and delegate only when the bounded task clearly
benefits. Log the selected agent and model. Trust sourced research unless
uncertain, contradictory, or controlling a risky edit. Review every Builder
patch and own integration, final validation, staging, and commits. If an
optimized agent fails, report it and continue the task once with this flagship;
never cross provider families silently.
