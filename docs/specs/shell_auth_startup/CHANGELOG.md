# Shell Auth Startup Changelog

## 2026-07-15

- Made Keychain diagnostic capture compatible with inherited Bash `noclobber`.
- Added a rendered-helper regression test proving Herdr service-token validation succeeds under `set -C` without exposing credentials.

## 2026-06-22

- Created shell auth startup spec after RCA found stuck `op read` processes and Herdr auth fanout.
- Removed Herdr profile auto-hydration so restored panes do not run `secret` automatically.
- Added bounded 1Password CLI execution and session-cache locking for `secret` / `op-session`.
- Changed Clockify SketchyBar polling to use only cached/env API keys; poll loop no longer calls `op read`.
- Removed Databricks `onepasswordRead` template calls; `secret` now exports Databricks env vars.
- Verification: shell syntax checks passed; `secret` with `OP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=2` failed fast in non-TTY.

## 2026-07-02

- Changed Herdr secret loading to use `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` from the environment or a machine-local macOS Keychain service/account.
- Herdr panes now fail fast instead of attempting delegated desktop `op signin`.
- Added explicit `Automation` vault scoping for the `Shell Secrets` item fetch required by service accounts.
- Changed the default `ShellSecretsItem` id to the copied item in `Automation`.
- Changed `secret` to source sibling `op-session` directly so existing panes do not need `hash -r` after deploys.

## 2026-07-13

- Preserved actionable macOS Keychain errors while keeping service-account tokens out of output.
- Added Keychain Access repair guidance after `security -w` interactive input truncated the service-account token to 128 characters.
- Added a credential-free Aqua LaunchAgent after RCA found the headless persistent Herdr server could not access the login Keychain.
