## Use Data Skipping Indices for Non-ORDER BY Filters

**Impact: HIGH**

Filters outside ORDER BY may benefit from partition pruning, projections or skipping indexes. Determine actual pruning from plans and representative data; absence from the sort key alone does not prove a full scan. Data skipping indices store metadata about blocks and skip granules that definitely don't match.

**Important:** Skip indices should be considered **after** optimizing data types, primary key selection, and materialized views.

**When to use:**
- High overall cardinality but low cardinality within blocks
- Rare values critical for search (error codes, specific IDs)
- Column correlates with primary key

**When NOT to use:**
- As a first optimization step
- Matching values scattered across many blocks
- Without testing on real data

**Incorrect (filtering on non-ORDER BY column):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_type LowCardinality(String),
    timestamp DateTime,
    user_id UInt64    -- Not in ORDER BY
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (event_type, toDate(timestamp));

-- Query filters on user_id - scans all matching event_type
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE event_type = 'click' AND user_id = 12345;
```

**Correct (add skipping index):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_type LowCardinality(String),
    timestamp DateTime,
    user_id UInt64,
    INDEX idx_user_id user_id TYPE bloom_filter GRANULARITY 4
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (event_type, toDate(timestamp));

-- Or add to existing table
ALTER TABLE events ADD INDEX idx_user_id user_id TYPE bloom_filter GRANULARITY 4;
ALTER TABLE events MATERIALIZE INDEX idx_user_id;
```

**Index types:**

| Type | Best For | Example Filter |
|------|----------|----------------|
| `bloom_filter` | Equality on high-cardinality | `WHERE user_id = 123` |
| `set(N)` | Low cardinality (N unique values) | `WHERE status IN ('a','b')` |
| `minmax` | Range queries | `WHERE amount > 1000` |
| `ngrambf_v1` | Text search | `WHERE text LIKE '%term%'` |
| `tokenbf_v1` | Token search | `WHERE hasToken(text, 'word')` |

**Validation:**

```sql
EXPLAIN indexes = 1
SELECT * FROM events WHERE user_id = 12345;
-- Look for "Skip" in output showing granules skipped
```
